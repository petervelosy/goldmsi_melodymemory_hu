This README contains information about the Gold-MSI Melody Memory Task.

=== Who made it? ===

This test was designed by Dr Daniel Müllensiefen, Dr Bruno Gingras, and Dr Lauren Stewart from the Music, Mind and Brain Research Group, Goldsmiths, University of London. 
It was implemented into the open-source application PsychoPy2 Experiment Builder (v1.79.01) (Jonathan Peirce, University of Nottingham) by Dr Estela Puig Waldmüller and Dr Bruno Gingras at the Department of Cognitive Biology, University of Vienna.

=== How does it work? ===

* The PsychoPy version of the Gold-MSI Melody Memory Test was developed on Mac OSX, Version 10.6.8 (2.26 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 2 GB 1067 MHz DDR3).
* The experiment was created and tested with PsychoPy2 Experiment Builder v1.79.01.
* The PPT file contains instructions for the participants. The instructions are available in English or German language.
* To run the experiment, open the PSYEXP file with PsychoPy, and run it within the Builder view (CMD + 'r'). The experiment is available in English or German language.

=== How are the results analyzed? ===


* The data from each experimental run is saved in the 'data' subdirectory as a csv file with the current date and experiment start time
* Results can be analyzed with the R script provided by Gold-MSI ('gmsi_test_scoring.r', see documentation).
